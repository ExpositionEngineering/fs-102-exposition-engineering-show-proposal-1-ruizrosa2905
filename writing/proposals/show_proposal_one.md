## 🎉 Show Description

The content of this episode will show you that it is important to think twice if this career is really for you. It will show you that opinions are important but that they are not meant to be followed if you don't feel good about them. Likewise, it will show you that you are not the only one who has gone through this situation and that there are people who have already experienced it and feel the pressure of disappointing someone important or making that decision because it is what people expect from you.


## 📢 Call to Action

I wish they asked themselves this question. Is it really what you want or are you doing it because that's what people expect of you?

This action would put the audience in the position of thinking deeply about whether it is what they want from them or what people want from them.
