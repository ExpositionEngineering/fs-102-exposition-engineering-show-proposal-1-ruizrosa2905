## üèÅ One Sentence Pitch

A show highlighting the significance of effectively communicating one's thoughts and feelings while making decisions.

## üî¨ Show Details

- **Title**: My Parents' Decision, Not Mine.
- **Host**: Gregory M. Kapfhammer.
- **Guest**: Rosa Ruiz.

## üìù Show Objectives

- **Objective One**: Show the audience that following others' opinions without thinking is not always a good idea.
- **Objective One**: Explain to the audience that the reason you don't have an answer is that you didn't actually choose that career; it was chosen for you by others.
- **Objective Three**: Emphasize to the audience the importance of feeling confident and comfortable with your decisions.

## üìö Sample Questions

- **Question one**: When did you realize that you were following your parents' dreams?

- **Question Two**: What was your answer when people asked you why you chose that career?

- **Question Three**: How did changing your plans for your career make you feel?

- **Justification for Question One**: Question 1 aligns with my objective of understanding the impact of external opinions on personal decisions. Realizing that your career path is influenced by others can be eye-opening, particularly when it's not what you truly desire for your life.
  
- **Justification for Question Two**: Question 2 supports my objective to identify if your career choice was your own. Often, people don't have a clear answer when asked why they chose a particular career, indicating that it may have been shaped by external suggestions, such as parents' opinions, rather than personal preference.

- **Justification for Question Three**: Question 3 helps achieve my objective of indicating your emotional response to changing career plans. It's crucial to understand whether the new career path feels more aligned with your own goals and provides a sense of fulfillment.

## üéâ Show Description

The content of this episode emphasizes the importance of carefully considering whether a certain career is truly right for you. It also highlights the fact that while opinions are valuable, it's not necessary to follow them if they don't align with your own feelings. Additionally, the episode shares that you're not alone in facing the pressure of disappointing someone important or making a decision that's expected of you. There are others who have gone through the same situation and can relate to what you're feeling.

## üì¢ Call to Action

**Call to Action**: I wish people would ask themselves this question: Is this really what you want, or are you only doing it because it's what others expect of you? By asking this, it would encourage individuals to deeply reflect on whether their actions align with their own desires or if they are merely conforming to societal expectations.
